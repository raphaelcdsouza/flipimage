# flipimage

![](./demo/demo.gif)

This project is a resolution of [this beginner project](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Flip-Image-App.md) of [App Ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) repository.

Below are listed the main features that the application should have and also the bonus features implemented:

### User Stories

-   [x] User can see a pane containing a single image repeated in a 2x2 matrix
-   [x] User can flip any one of the images vertically or horizontally using a set of up, down, left, and right arrows next to the image

### Bonus features

-   [x] User can change the default image by entering the URL of a different image in an input field
-   [x] User can display the new image by clicking a 'Display' button next to the input field
-   [x] User can see an error message if the new images URL is not found

With this little project I've learned concepts about:

- CSS transform property;
- CSS selectors;
- JS fetch API;
- JS error handling;

Check my code out and feel free to make suggestions or improvements.
